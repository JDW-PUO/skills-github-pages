The wind rattled the shutters of the old lighthouse as Mara wiped the fog from her lantern. She had only meant to explore the coastline for an afternoon, but the rising tide had swallowed the trail home, forcing her to take refuge inside the abandoned tower. As she climbed the spiral staircase, each step groaned under her weight, echoing through the hollow chamber like a warning she wasn’t sure she should ignore.

At the top, she found a dusty journal resting on a pedestal, its pages fluttering as though stirred by an unseen hand. The entries told of a keeper who vanished one stormy night after reporting strange lights beneath the waves. Just as Mara closed the book, a glow seeped through the window, illuminating the ocean below. The lights moved in patterns—too deliberate to be nature, too beautiful to be danger—and Mara realized she wasn’t as alone as she’d thought.
